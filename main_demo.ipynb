    "This final output demonstrates a common challenge in real-world data science: dealing with sparse or inconsistent data. The code is working correctly, but the specific data in this file prevents the matching functions from producing a result.\n",

    "1. **No Predicted ADRs**:\n",
    "The \"Approximate String Match\" section is blank because, for this specific file (LIPITOR.493.txt), our NER model did not happen to predict any text segments as ADR. This is a normal limitation of any model; it won't be perfect on every file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Ground Truth Found for Matching**:\n",
    "The \"Embedding Model\" reports that no ground truth data was found. This is due to a subtle inconsistency in the dataset's annotation files for this specific sample. Even though we programmatically found this file as a likely candidate, it turns out that none of its ADR entities have a corresponding standard code in the sct file, leaving nothing for our linking functions to match against."
